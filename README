       as_xml ( ENGINE )

       to_file ( ENGINE, PATH )
           Creates a XML-representation of _E_N_G_I_N_E and saves it at _P_A_T_H.

       The structure of the XML created by this writer is described in "XML
       Document structure" in Kvasir::Loader::XML.

       Arguments to entities (actions, inputs, hooks, outputs and rules) will
       be tested to see if it's a single hash reference and if so be written
       as such using the key as element name and the value as the elements
       text content.

       However, if the implementing class of the entitiy implements the method
       "process_xml_writers_args" this will be called as a class method and is
       responsible for adding children to the element. The arguments to the
       method are the document as a "XML::LibXML::Document"-instance, the
       entity-element as "XML::LibXML::Element"-instance which to add children
       to and a list of the arguments encapsulated by "Kvasir::Type-
       Decl"-instance that represents the entity.
